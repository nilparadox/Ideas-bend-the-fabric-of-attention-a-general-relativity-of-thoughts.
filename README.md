# Information Gravity — A Geometric Theory of Meaning and Attention

Dense ideas bend the fabric of attention.  
This repository explores the analogy between **gravity** and **meaning**,  
where information density produces curvature in a cognitive spacetime,  
and **attention** follows **geodesics** through this manifold.

## 🧩 Overview

This project models thought as motion under a field of **semantic gravity**.  
Each idea acts like a mass in an informational universe.  
Attention flows along curved paths—geodesics—toward regions of dense meaning.

The notebook `gravity.ipynb` implements:
- The **Information Potential Field** Φ  
- The **Information Curvature** κ = ∇²Φ  
- The **Geodesic Equation of Attention Flow**

Figures in `gravity.pdf` and this repository illustrate:
1. **Information Potential Field (Φ)** – semantic wells of meaning.  
2. **Information Curvature (κ)** – local “semantic density.”  
3. **Geodesic of Attention Flow** – thought falling into meaning.

## ⚙️ Mathematical Core

The field is defined as:
\[
\Phi(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_i \frac{m_i}{\|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_i\|+\epsilon}
\]

The attention flow evolves via the **geodesic equation**:
\[
\frac{d^2 \mathbf{r}}{dt^2} = -\nabla \Phi(\mathbf{r})
\]

The curvature tensor and scalar \( R \) define a local geometry:
\[
R_{ij} - \frac{1}{2} R\,g_{ij} = 8\pi T^{(\text{info})}_{ij}
\]
linking **information energy** to **semantic curvature**.

## 🌌 Interpretation

- High Φ → strong ideas, “semantic gravity wells.”  
- High κ → conceptual tension, novelty, or cognitive strain.  
- Geodesics → trajectories of focus and meaning.  

Entropy flux couples cognition to creativity:
\[
\frac{\partial S}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(S\mathbf{v}) = \sigma(\Phi)
\]
with \( \sigma > 0 \) for creative expansion, \( \sigma < 0 \) for analytical collapse.
